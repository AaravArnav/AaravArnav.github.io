        <h2>Message From Arnav</h2>
        <p>Dear Shiven,

            As you prepare to embark on your new journey, I wanted to take a moment to express how much you will be missed. It's hard to imagine our days without you, but I know you're going to do great things in (Jaipur/Kolkata im really not sure).
            
            I wanted to thank you for all the amazing memories we've shared together. From late night chats to spontaneous adventures, you've been an incredible friend and I feel so lucky to have had you in my life. I'll always cherish the moments we've spent together and look back on them with fondness.
            
            Although it's tough to say goodbye, I know this isn't the end of our friendship. Distance may separate us, but our bond will remain strong. Please keep in touch and let me know how you're doing. I'll be eagerly waiting to hear about all the wonderful things you'll accomplish.
            
            Wishing you all the best in your new endeavors. You're going to rock it!
            
            With love and admiration,
            Arnav</p>
